A set of files for laser cutting a case for arduino and network shield (enc28j60 based version) out of 3mm sheet.

It has holes in one face for usb, network and a spare hole for sensor wires or similar. If you have another network shield you may have to move the port holes on the end face.

Based on a design from thingiverse.com
