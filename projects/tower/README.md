# Tower

Alistair Turnbull's (makespace at minworks dot co dot uk) first experiment
with the laser cutter.

There are two versions of the puzzle in "tower.svg":

 - For the left-hand version, cut out three copies of the piece, and assemble
them so that they are all at right-angles to each other. This version works well.
 
 - For the right-hand version, cut out six copies of the piece. This version
works less well, and I invite fixes. :-)

The pieces are designed to but cut from a 3mm-thick sheet. Transparent acetate
looks rather cool. If you want to use a different thickness of material, you
should scale the pieces accordingly, or edit them to change the slot widths.
