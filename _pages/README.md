Stuff we made
=============

A repository for files for our laser, 3d printer(s), CNC mills and any other creative mayhem from the Cambridge Makespace. Sub-directories here should contain source files for designs along with any information, links to photos etc of the (semi)finished article. Check the licence and go play, or just take a look around to see what we're up to!

If you have made something cool, we'd love to include it here. Please fork the repo, make your changes, and send us a pull request on github.

## About us ##

Makespace ([makespace.org](http://makespace.org/)) is a community workshop, 4000 square feet of machine shop, classroom & storage filled with a variety of equipment from screwdrivers through 3d printers, laser cutter, CNC mills, lathe, glass working kiln, drill presses, electronics workstations and many more. We have space to chill out too, with a kitchen and cafe area. Members pay a monthly subscription for 24/7 access to everything in the space. We have regular open evenings where anyone can come along and see the space, and, for those particularly excited, sign up on the night, as well as maker nights where anyone can come and actually make things, although obviously without training we're not going to let you kill yourself on our lathe etc ;)
