Quadcopter airframe
===================

These are the files for a quadcopter (four engine flying thing) we're making:

The other parts in the photo are a motor (obviously) and a load of M3 screws and PCB stand-offs, 12mm nylon ones in this case screwed straight into the lower platters. This was done by cutting a 2.5mm diameter hole, the recommended tap diameter for an M3 screw, then after cutting on the laser tapping the hole with a steel M3 screw. This left a tight fit for the nylon stand-offs, possible to tighten with fingers but only just, the end result is light and very rigid, it might even manage to not instantly destroy itself the moment it takes off at this rate! (oh who am I kidding...). The lower platter also acts as the motor mount without any need for the normal cross shaped bit of aluminium.
